## üìä Using Demo Data

The application includes ready-to-use demo data for development and testing purposes. These demo conversations and messages feature characters from the Disco Elysium universe.

### Available Demo Data

1. **DUMMY_CONVERSATIONS**: Sample conversation entries with character names and profile pictures from the Disco Elysium universe.
2. **DUMMY_MESSAGES**: Sample dialogue exchanges styled like in-game conversations.

### Activating Demo Data (Development Mode)

We've provided an easy way to toggle between real API calls and demo data during development:

1. **Using Demo Conversations**:
   
   Open `frontend/src/hooks/useGetConversations.ts` and modify the following section:
   
   ```typescript
   // DEVELOPMENT MODE: Uncomment these lines to use dummy data
   // and comment out the API call below
   
   setConversations(DUMMY_CONVERSATIONS as ConversationType[]);
   setLoading(false);
   return;
   
   // PRODUCTION MODE: Comment out the above and uncomment below
   // ...API call code...
   ```

2. **Using Demo Messages**:
   
   Similarly, in `frontend/src/hooks/useGetMessages.ts`:
   
   ```typescript
   // DEVELOPMENT MODE: Uncomment these lines to use dummy data
   // and comment out the API call below
   
   setMessages(DUMMY_MESSAGES as MessageType[]);
   setLoading(false);
   return;
   
   // PRODUCTION MODE: Comment out the above and uncomment below
   // ...API call code...
   ```

3. **Fallback Mode** (already active):
   
   If you don't modify the code as described above, the application will still automatically use the dummy data if the API calls fail.

### Extending the Demo Data

You can easily extend the demo data by modifying the files in `frontend/src/data/dummy.ts`:

```typescript
// Add more conversations:
export const DUMMY_CONVERSATIONS = [
  // Your existing entries...
  {
    id: 6,
    fullName: "Cuno",
    profilePic: "https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=cuno&backgroundColor=7c3030",
    emoji: "üî™",
  },
  // More entries...
];

// Add more messages:
export const DUMMY_MESSAGES = [
  // Your existing messages...
  {
    id: 11,
    fromMe: false,
    body: "Cuno doesn't care! *spits*",
  },
  // More messages...
];
```

## üé® Design Philosophy

- Rich amber and red color schemes
- Typography that evokes both bureaucracy and mysticism
- Visual effects that mimic the game's unique art style
- Terminology that blends psychological concepts with detective work
